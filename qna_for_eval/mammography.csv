Question,Answer
What are the two primary challenges in mammographic analysis for early breast cancer detection?,Accurate risk assessment tools and effective screening tests.
What are the four categories of breast tissue density used in medical practice?,"Fatty (low density), scattered, heterogeneously dense, and dense."
What is the main advantage of using 3D tomosynthesis over 2D mammography?,"It helps reveal cancerous tissues that might be obscured in 2D projections, especially in dense breast tissue."
Why is the class imbalance a challenge in applying deep learning to mammogram datasets?,"Only around 0.7% of inputs are positive cases, making it harder to train effective models."
What was the AUC achieved by the hybrid deep learning model (image + classical features) for mammogram risk assessment?,The hybrid model achieved an AUC of 0.7.
